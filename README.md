# Tic-Tac-Toe Almdrasa

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. It was developed as a project for the Almdrasa Python course.

## How to Play

1. Run the script `tic-tac-toe.py` using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python tic-tac-toe.py
```

2. The game window will appear.
3. You will be playing as "X" and the computer will play as "O".
4. Click on any cell in the 3x3 grid to make your move.
5. The computer will then make its move automatically after a short delay.
6. The game will continue until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
7. To restart the game, click the "Restart" button.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
- If all 9 cells are filled without any player achieving a winning condition, the game ends in a draw.
